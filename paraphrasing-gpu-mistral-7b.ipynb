In our opinion, the Successor Company's financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Successor Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 and for the period from September 10, 2016 to December 31, 2016 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Further, in our opinion, the Predecessor Company financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, its operations and its cash flows for the period from January 1, 2016 to September 9, 2016 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.   We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 12, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.   As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, on September 8, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order confirming the plan of reorganization which became effective after the close of business on September 9, 2016. Accordingly, the accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with FASB Accounting Standard Codification 852, Reorganizations, for the Successor Company as a new entity with assets, liabilities, and a capital structure having carrying values not comparable with prior periods as described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.  Basis for Opinion   These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.   We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

Opinion on the financial statements  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Jones Energy, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2018, the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2018, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2018, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Going concern  The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company has substantial debt obligations requiring significant interest payments. The ongoing capital and operating expenditures, including the debt interest payments, will vastly exceed the amount of cash on hand and the revenue they expect to generate from operations in the near future. These conditions, along with other matters as set forth in Note 3, raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.     Basis for opinion  These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.  We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting     A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.     /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP  Sacramento, California  March 8, 2019     We have served as the Companys auditor since at least 1984; however, an earlier year could not be reliably determined.  \n///////////////////////////////////\n---------------------------\n1310067\n----------------------------\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Sears Holdings Corporation  Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Sears Holdings Corporation and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of February 3, 2018 and January 28, 2017, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), deficit, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended February 3, 2018, and the related notes and the schedule listed in the Index at Item 8 (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\").

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting  A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  /s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP   Deloitte & Touche LLP  Chicago, Illinois  March 23, 2018  We have served as the Company's auditor since 2005.  \n///////////////////////////////////\n---------------------------\n1690769\n----------------------------\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  To the Stockholders and Board of Directors  Alta Mesa Resources, Inc.:  Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Alta Mesa Resources, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2018, the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders equity (Successor), changes in partners capital (Predecessor) and cash flows for the period from January 1, 2018 to February 8, 2018 (Predecessor) and from February 9, 2018 to December 31, 2018 (Successor), and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements).

Substantial Doubt About the Companys Ability to Continue as a Going Concern     The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Going Concern Uncertainty     The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has determined that, based on its current operating forecast, it will not comply with its debt covenants contained in its revolving credit facility in 2019 which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Going Concern  The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Companys current liquidity is not sufficient to meet its obligations within one year of the date of issuance of the financial statements, which raises substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern.

The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  Change in Accounting Principle  As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for changes in instrument-specific credit risk of its junior subordinated notes, at fair value due to the adoption of an accounting standard classified under FASB ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments.

Board of Directors of FTD Companies, Inc.  Opinion on the Financial Statements  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of FTD Companies, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, and the related notes and the schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 18, 2019, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting.  Going Concern  The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the outstanding balance of the Companys term loan and all amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility (credit agreement) are due upon maturity in September 2019. The Company anticipates that, during 2019, prior to the maturity of the credit agreement, it may not be in compliance with certain requirements and covenants of its credit agreement. The Company may not have sufficient liquidity to repay the obligations due under its credit agreement upon maturity, or earlier if called for repayment by the lenders. Further, the credit facility may not provide sufficient liquidity over the remaining term of the revolving credit facility. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  Basis for Opinion  These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  /s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP  Chicago, Illinois  March 18, 2019  We have served as the Companys auditor since 2014.\n\n\n\nToken

shareholders and board of directors of FTD Companies, Inc. Our focus here is on the consolidated financial statements of FTD Companies, Inc. and its subsidiaries for the years ending December 31, 2018 and 2017, including the related statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for the three-year period ending December 31, 2018. Additionally, we audited the company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018.\n\nIn our professional judgment, these financial statements provide a fair representation of the company's financial condition as of the specified dates, along with its operational performance and cash flow for the stated three-year period, in line with the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America.\n\nRegarding the internal control over financial reporting, our findings were based on the criteria set out in the Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Our report dated March 18, 2019, expresses an unqualified opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\nIt should be noted that the financial statements were prepared under the assumption that the company will continue to operate as a going concern. However, certain terms of the company's credit agreement, which includes the outstanding balance of the term loan and amounts due under the revolving credit facility, are scheduled to mature in September 2019. There is a possibility that the company may fail to meet certain requirements and covenants of the credit agreement in 2019. If such circumstances arise, the company may not have enough liquidity to repay its obligations when they come due or upon early repayment request by the lenders. Moreover, the revolving credit facility may not provide adequate liquidity throughout its remaining term.

Our focus here is on the consolidated financial statements of FTD Companies, Inc. and its subsidiaries for the years ending December 31, 2018 and 2017, including the related statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for the three-year period ending December 31, 2018. Additionally, we audited the company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018.\n\nIn our professional judgment, these financial statements provide a fair representation of the company's financial condition as of the specified dates, along with its operational performance and cash flow for the stated three-year period, in line with the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America.\n\nRegarding the internal control over financial reporting, our findings were based on the criteria set out in the Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Our report dated March 18, 2019, expresses an unqualified opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\nIt should be noted that the financial statements were prepared under the assumption that the company will continue to operate as a going concern. However, certain terms of the company's credit agreement, which includes the outstanding balance of the term loan and amounts due under the revolving credit facility, are scheduled to mature in September 2019. There is a possibility that the company may fail to meet certain requirements and covenants of the credit agreement in 2019. If such circumstances arise, the company may not have enough liquidity to repay its obligations when they come due or upon early repayment request by the lenders. Moreover, the revolving credit facility may not provide adequate liquidity throughout its remaining term. These circumstances cast doubt on the company's capacity to maintain its status as a going concern. The financial statements do not reflect any potential adjustments that could result from resolving this uncertainty.\n\nOur auditing responsibilities pertain to the company's financial statements, with the company's management being responsible for their preparation.

The original text can be found here: REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of FTD Companies, Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of FTD Companies, Inc. and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, and the related notes and the schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 18, 2019, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Going Concern The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the outstanding balance of the Company’s term loan and all amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility (\"credit agreement\") are due upon maturity in September 2019. The Company anticipates that, during 2019, prior to the maturity of the credit agreement, it may not be in compliance with certain requirements and covenants of its credit agreement. The Company may not have sufficient liquidity to repay the obligations due under its credit agreement upon maturity, or earlier if called for repayment by the lenders. Further, the credit facility may not provide sufficient liquidity over the remaining term of the revolving credit facility. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP Chicago, Illinois March 18, 2019 We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2014.\n--- End RAW LLM Output for Attempt 2 ---\n\n--- MODIFIED OUTPUT (Paraphrase Only) for Attempt 2 ---\n****\nOur independent audit report on the consolidated financial statements of FTD Companies, Inc. and its subsidiaries for the years ending December 31, 2018 and 2017 has been completed.

No adjustments have been made to the financial statements to account for the potential outcomes of this uncertainty.\n\nOur audit responsibilities involve expressing an opinion on the financial statements based on our audit. We are a registered public accounting firm with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, and we maintain our independence with respect to the company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the relevant rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, which requires us to plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free of material misstatements, whether due to error or fraud. Our audit involved assessing the risks of material misstatement, testing evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, evaluating accounting principles and management's significant estimates, and reviewing the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n--- End MODIFIED OUTPUT for Attempt 2 ---\n\n","output_type":"stream"},{"name":"stderr","text":"GPU Utilization:   0%|          | 0%

for the financial reports of FTD Companies, Inc., presenting this report to the company's stockholders and board of directors. Our audit covered the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, along with the related statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for the three-year period ending December 31, 2018. We have concluded that these financial statements offer a fair representation of the company's financial position as of the mentioned dates and its operational and cash flow results for the stated timeframe, adhering to accounting principles in the United States.\n\nIn addition to auditing the financial statements, we also evaluated the company's internal control over financial reporting, as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria set by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Our report dated March 18, 2019, expressed an unqualified opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that the financial statements are predicated on the assumption that the company will maintain operations as a going concern. As detailed in Note 1, the company has obligations under a term loan and a revolving credit facility due for repayment in September 2019. There is a possibility that the company may not comply with certain requirements and covenants within its credit agreement during 2019, which raises doubts about the company's capacity to continue as a going concern. If the company fails to meet these obligations, it may not have enough liquidity to repay its debts upon maturity or when demanded by the lenders. Furthermore, the credit facility may not supply adequate liquidity throughout the remaining term of the revolving credit facility.\n\nOur auditing work was performed independently according to the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), and our audit aimed to ensure that the financial statements were free of material misstatements, whether caused by error or fraud. Our audit included assessing the risks of material misstatements and performing procedures responsive to those risks, including examining evidence supporting the financial statements on a test basis.

The company anticipates that it may not meet certain requirements and covenants of the credit agreement during 2019, which raises doubts about its ability to operate as a going concern.

Our evaluation covers consolidated balance sheets, income statements, comprehensive loss statements, stockholders' equity statements, and cash flow statements for the three-year period ending December 31, 2018. We confirm that these financial statements, when considered as a whole, offer a fair representation of the company's financial situation, operational performance, and cash flow activities, adhering to the generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.\n\nAdditionally, we audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, using criteria provided by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Our report dated March 18, 2019, expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal controls.\n\nA significant issue to consider is the company's going concern status, which is crucial to understanding these financial statements. According to Note 1, the company's term loan and revolving credit facility (known as the 'credit agreement') will mature in September 2019. The company may struggle to meet certain requirements and covenants within the credit agreement during 2019, casting doubt on its ability to continue operating as a going concern. This uncertainty could lead to insufficient liquidity to repay debts upon maturity or earlier repayment requests by lenders, and a lack of adequate liquidity over the remaining term of the revolving credit facility. The financial statements do not incorporate any adjustments resulting from this uncertainty.\n\nOur audit process entailed expressing an opinion on the company's financial statements, following the standards set by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB). We planned and executed our audits to achieve reasonable assurance that the financial statements were free of material errors or intentional manipulations. Our procedures included assessing the risks of material misstatements, responding to those risks through testing evidence, evaluating accounting principles, scrutinizing significant estimates, and reviewing the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe our audits provide a solid foundation for our opinion.\n\nSince 2014, we have served as the company's auditor.\n\n****\n--- End RAW LLM Output for Attempt 5 ---\n\n--- MODIFIED OUTPUT (Paraphrase Only) for Attempt 5 ---\n****\nWe hereby submit our report to the shareholders and board of directors of FTD Companies, Inc., detailing our findings on their financial statements.

We also have audited the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).     In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 30, 2018, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.     Basis for Opinions     The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.     We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.     Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.     Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting     A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.     /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP  Sacramento, California  March 8, 2019     We have served as the Companys auditor since at least 1984; however, an earlier year could not be reliably determined.  \n\n\n\nToken count of original audit opinion text: 1122\nWord count of original audit opinion text:

of directors of The McClatchy Company, presenting our findings on both the financial statements and the internal control over financial reporting. For the fiscal years ending December 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, we audited the consolidated balance sheets, income statements, comprehensive loss statements, stockholders' equity statements, and cash flow statements of the Company. Additionally, we evaluated the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2018, based on the guidelines set out in the Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\n\nIn our professional judgment, the presented financial statements offer a fair representation of the Company’s financial position as of the specified dates and their operational results and cash flow for the respective two-year period. Furthermore, we affirm that the Company effectively managed its internal control over financial reporting during the same period, adhering to the aforementioned framework.\n\nOur role is to express opinions on these financial statements and the Company's internal control over financial reporting, which we have done based on our audits. We are a publicly registered accounting firm under the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), ensuring our independence from the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws, SEC, and PCAOB rules and regulations.\n\nOur auditing methods were carried out in compliance with PCAOB standards, which entail planning and executing the audits to gain reasonable assurance that the financial statements do not contain any material errors or fraudulent information. During our audits, we scrutinized the accounting practices employed and significant judgments made by management while considering the overall presentation of the financial statements. For the internal control assessment, we gained an understanding of the system, identified potential material weaknesses, and tested and evaluated the design and operational efficiency of the controls based on the perceived risks. Other procedures deemed necessary were also performed as required. We believe our audits provide a solid foundation for our opinions.\n\nIt's essential to understand that internal control over financial reporting serves to ensure the accuracy and fairness of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements according to generally accepted accounting principles. This control system includes policies and procedures designed to maintain accurate transaction records, ensure proper recording of transactions, and safeguard against unauthorized asset acquisition, usage, or disposal that could significantly impact the financial statements. However, it should be noted that internal control over financial reporting may not entirely prevent or identify misstatements due to its inherent limitations.

report to the shareholders and board of directors of The McClatchy Company. Our audit covers the consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting for the years ending December 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017.\n\nIn our professional opinion, the financial statements offer a fair representation, without significant errors, of the company's financial position as of December 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017. They also accurately depict the company's operational performance and cash flow for both years under review. Furthermore, we confirm that the company effectively managed its internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2018, according to the criteria outlined in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\n\nManagement is accountable for preparing these financial statements and for maintaining internal control over financial reporting, while our role is to express opinions on them based on our audits. As a U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB)-registered firm, we are required to maintain our independence relative to the company in adherence with U.S. federal securities laws and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nOur auditing process followed PCAOB standards, which entail planning and executing the audits to secure reasonable confidence that the financial statements are devoid of material misstatements resulting from either error or fraud, and that effective internal control over financial reporting was consistently maintained.\n\nOur auditing procedure encompassed evaluating the accounting principles employed, the significant judgments made by management, and the overall presentation of the financial statements. For internal control over financial reporting, our audit involved understanding the internal control mechanisms, assessing the likelihood of a material weakness, and testing and evaluating the design and operational effectiveness of these controls based on the identified risks. Our audits also comprised additional procedures deemed necessary given the specific circumstances. We deem our audits provide a solid basis for our opinions.\n\nIt is crucial to understand that internal control over financial reporting is a system designed to ensure the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in line with generally accepted accounting principles. This system comprises policies and procedures that help maintain accurate and fair transaction records, ensure transactions are properly documented, and minimize the risk of unauthorized asset acquisition, use, or disposition that might materially impact the financial statements. However, it should be noted that internal control over financial reporting does not guarantee the elimination of errors or fraud. Additionally, projections of internal control effectiveness to future periods carry the risk that controls may become ineffective due to changes in conditions or declines in compliance with policies or procedures.\n\n****\n\nWe have been The McClatchy Company's auditors since 1984, though an earlier starting point could not be accurately determined.\n\nIn summary, our audit has confirmed that the financial statements offer a fair representation of the company's financial position and operational performance, and that its internal control over financial reporting was effectively managed as of December 30, 2018. We stand by our opinions, but it is important to note that internal control systems can change over time and may not completely eliminate errors or fraud. Projections of internal control effectiveness to future periods should take into account potential changes in conditions or decreases in compliance.\n\n*****End of Paraphrased Text*****\n\nThis paraphrase aims to convey the original text's meaning using different words and sentence structures while retaining the essential information.

What are the limitations of internal control over financial reporting?\n- Due to its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Additionally, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n10. How long has Deloitte & Touche LLP been The McClatchy Company's auditor?\n- Deloitte & Touche LLP has been The McClatchy Company's auditor since at least 1984; however, an earlier year could not be reliably determined.\n--- End RAW LLM Output for Attempt 3 ---\n\n--- MODIFIED OUTPUT (Paraphrase Only) for Attempt 3 ---\n****\nWe are Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, presenting this report to the shareholders and board of directors of The McClatchy Company. Our audit covers the consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting for the years ending December 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017.\n\nIn our professional opinion, the financial statements offer a fair representation, without significant errors, of the company's financial position as of December 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017. They also accurately depict the company's operational performance and cash flow for both years under review. Furthermore, we confirm that the company effectively managed its internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2018, according to the criteria outlined in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\n\nManagement is accountable for preparing these financial statements and for maintaining internal control over financial reporting, while our role is to express opinions on them based on our audits. As a U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB)-registered firm, we are required to maintain our independence relative to the company in adherence with U.S. federal securities laws and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nOur auditing process followed PCAOB standards, which entail planning and executing the audits to secure reasonable confidence that the financial statements are devoid of material misstatements resulting from either error or fraud, and that effective internal control over financial reporting was consistently maintained.\n\nOur auditing procedure encompassed evaluating the accounting principles employed, the significant judgments made by management, and the overall presentation of the financial statements. For internal control over financial reporting, our audit involved understanding the internal control mechanisms, assessing the likelihood of a material weakness, and testing and evaluating the design and operational effectiveness of these controls based on the identified risks. Our audits also comprised additional procedures deemed necessary given the specific circumstances. We deem our audits provide a solid basis for our opinions.\n\nIt is crucial to understand that internal control over financial reporting is a system designed to ensure the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in line with generally accepted accounting principles. This system comprises policies and procedures that help maintain accurate and fair transaction records, ensure transactions are properly documented, and minimize the risk of unauthorized asset acquisition, use, or disposition that might materially impact the financial statements. However, it should be noted that internal control over financial reporting does not guarantee the elimination of errors or fraud. Additionally, projections of internal control effectiveness to future periods carry the risk that controls may become ineffective due to changes in conditions or declines in compliance with policies or procedures.\n--- End MODIFIED OUTPUT for Attempt 3 ---\n\n\u001b[H\u001b[2J","output_type":"stream"},{"name":"stderr","text":"GPU Utilization:   0%|          | 0% , GPU0: 50%/8003MB | GPU1:

We also examined the accounting principles used, the estimates made by management, and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In terms of ICFR, we gained an understanding of the system, assessed potential material weaknesses, and tested and evaluated its design and operational efficiency based on identified risks.

Our findings indicate that the financial statements provide a fair presentation of the company's financial position, results of operations, and cash flows in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) in the United States. Moreover, we found that the company's ICFR was effective as of December 30, 2018.\n\nOur responsibilities encompass expressing opinions on the financial statements and the company's ICFR based on our audits. As a registered public accounting firm with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), we uphold our independence in relation to the company in compliance with U.S. federal securities laws, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and PCAOB regulations.\n\nDuring our audits, we executed procedures aimed at gaining reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free of material misstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and that ICFR was adequately maintained. These procedures included evaluating accounting principles, key estimates, and the presentation of financial statements, in addition to testing the design and operating effectiveness of ICFR. Our audits covered risks associated with material misstatements and responding to those risks through appropriate procedures.\n\nInternal Control Over Financial Reporting refers to a process designed to provide reasonable assurance that financial statements comply with GAAP and accurately reflect the company's financial transactions. This process encompasses policies and procedures concerning the recording, authorizing, and preventing unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of assets affecting the financial statements. It is essential to note that ICFR does not guarantee the absence of misstatements and that evaluations of effectiveness are susceptible to risks arising from changes in conditions or deterioration in compliance with policies and procedures.\n\nAs of March 8, 2019, we have served as the company's auditor since at least 1984, though we are unable to specify an earlier year with certainty.\n\n****\n--- End RAW LLM Output for Attempt 6 ---\n\n--- MODIFIED OUTPUT (Paraphrase Only) for Attempt 6 ---\n****\nWe offer this report as an independent auditing firm, addressed to the shareholders and board of directors of The McClatchy Company.

We also have audited the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of February 3, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of February 3, 2018 and January 28, 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended February 3, 2018, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of February 3, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.  Basis for Opinions  The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.  Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.  Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting  A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  /s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP   Deloitte & Touche LLP  Chicago, Illinois  March 23, 2018  We have served as the Company's auditor since 2005.

shareholders and the Board of Directors of Sears Holdings Corporation. Our purpose is to provide our professional opinions on the financial statements and internal control over financial reporting for the corporation.\n\nFor the consolidated balance sheets of Sears Holdings Corporation and its subsidiaries, as of February 3, 2018, and January 28, 2017, along with the related statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), deficit, and cash flows for the three-year period ending February 3, 2018, and the accompanying notes and schedules, we opine that they have been presented fairly, without any significant errors or fraud, and in line with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Furthermore, we state that Sears Holdings Corporation has maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of February 3, 2018, based on the framework established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\n\nOur audit responsibilities involve ensuring that the financial statements are accurate and free from material misstatements, whether caused by error or fraud. Our audit approach includes assessing the risks of potential errors or fraud in the financial statements and conducting tests to verify the accuracy of the amounts and disclosures presented. Additionally, we evaluate the accounting principles employed, management's significant estimates, and the overall presentation of the financial statements.\n\nIn our audit of internal control over financial reporting, we gained an understanding of the internal control processes, assessed the risk of material weaknesses, and tested the design and operational effectiveness of the controls based on the identified risks. Our audit also included additional procedures deemed necessary in the specific circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a solid foundation for our opinions.\n\nInternal control over financial reporting is a system designed to ensure the integrity of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements according to generally accepted accounting principles. This system encompasses policies and procedures that ensure proper recording of transactions, adherence to authorized management and board decisions, and prevention or prompt detection of unauthorized asset acquisitions, uses, or disposals that could materially impact the financial statements.\n\nIt is important to note that internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or identify all errors, and its effectiveness may diminish over time due to changes in conditions or decreased compliance with policies and procedures. Moreover, predictions about the effectiveness of controls in future periods carry the risk that they may become insufficient.\n\n***\nDeloitte & Touche LLP\nChicago, Illinois\nMarch 23, 2018\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2005.\n\nThis paraphrase aims to preserve the original meaning and structure of the text while using different words and sentence structures.

and Board of Directors of Sears Holdings Corporation\n\nOpinions on Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the consolidated financial statements of Sears Holdings Corporation and its subsidiaries for the three-year period ending February 3, 2018, including the balance sheets, income statements, cash flow statements, and notes. Additionally, we have assessed the internal control over financial reporting of the company as of February 3, 2018. Based on auditing standards set by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), we offer the following opinions:\n\n1. The financial statements provide a fair presentation, without material discrepancies, of the company's financial position as of February 3, 2018, and January 28, 2017, as well as its operational results and cash flows for the three-year period ending February 3, 2018, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.\n2. The company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of February 3, 2018, based on criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\n\nResponsibilities and Basis for Opinions\nManagement is responsible for preparing the financial statements and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, while we, as auditors, are tasked with providing opinions on these financial statements and the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. As a registered public accounting firm with the PCAOB, we must maintain independence with respect to the company according to U.S. federal securities laws, SEC, and PCAOB regulations.\n\nOur auditing procedures included assessing risks of material misstatement, examining evidence, evaluating accounting principles and management's estimates, and overall financial statement presentation. For internal control over financial reporting, we obtained an understanding of the system, evaluated risks, tested and evaluated the design and operating effectiveness of controls, and performed additional procedures as necessary. We believe our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nInternal control over financial reporting is a process designed to ensure the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. It encompasses policies and procedures related to accurate and fair recording of transactions, authorization of transactions, and preventing or detecting unauthorized asset acquisition, use, or disposition that could materially affect financial statements. However, it is important to note that internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements, and projections of evaluations to future periods are subject to the risk of controls becoming inadequate or compliance deteriorating.\n\n****\nDeloitte & Touche LLP has been the company's auditor since 2005.\nChicago, Illinois\nMarch 23, 2018\n****\nIn summary, our audits conclude that the financial statements and internal control over financial reporting of Sears Holdings Corporation are presented fairly and in accordance with the relevant standards, and the company maintains effective internal control over financial reporting as of the specified date, subject to inherent limitations and potential changes in conditions. The report also emphasizes the roles and responsibilities of both the company's management and the auditors in this process. Finally, it clarifies that internal control over financial reporting aims to ensure the reliability of financial reporting and adherence to generally accepted accounting principles, but cannot completely eliminate the possibility of material misstatements or future inadequacies. The report concludes with the signature and location of Deloitte & Touche LLP, who have acted as the company's auditor since 2005.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n--- End RAW LLM Output for Attempt 2 ---\n\n--- MODIFIED OUTPUT (Paraphrase Only) for Attempt 2 ---\n****\nThe Independent Auditor's Report of Deloitte & Touche LLP\nTo the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Sears Holdings Corporation\n\nOpinions on Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the consolidated financial statements of Sears Holdings Corporation and its subsidiaries for the three-year period ending February 3, 2018, including the balance sheets, income statements, cash flow statements, and notes.

For the internal control over financial reporting audit, we obtained an understanding of the system, assessed the risk of a material weakness, and tested and evaluated the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls based on the identified risk.\n\nInternal control over financial reporting refers to a process aimed at providing reasonable assurance about the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. It encompasses policies and procedures that ensure accurate and fair recording of transactions, authorization of transactions, and prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisitions, uses, or dispositions of the company's assets that could significantly impact the financial statements.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that internal control over financial reporting may not completely prevent or detect misstatements due to its inherent limitations. Furthermore, the effectiveness of controls can change or deteriorate over time, which may impact their ability to maintain accuracy in future periods.\n\nWe have been serving as the company's auditor since 2005.\n--- End MODIFIED OUTPUT for Attempt 3 ---\n\n","output_type":"stream"},{"name":"stderr","text":"GPU Utilization:   0%|          | 0% , GPU0: 46%/8003MB | GPU1:

Corporation's shareholders and Board of Directors. Our focus is on the consolidated financial statements of the company and its internal control over financial reporting for the period ending February 3, 2018, compared to January 28, 2017.\n\nOur assessment concludes that the financial statements present the company's financial position, operational results, and cash flow for the past three years, in line with U.S. accounting standards, without significant errors or misrepresentations. Furthermore, we found that the company's internal control system was effective throughout this period, following the guidelines set by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\n\nIn terms of responsibilities, it is the management's duty to maintain accurate financial statements and effective internal controls, and they have provided an assessment of their internal control's effectiveness in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our role is to evaluate these financial statements and the company's internal control system based on our audits. We must maintain independence in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and regulations from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB).\n\nDuring our audits, we followed the standards of the PCAOB, which require us to ensure the financial statements are free from material errors or fraud, and that adequate internal controls are maintained. Our audits involved assessing risks of potential misstatements, conducting tests to verify evidence regarding financial statement amounts and disclosures, evaluating management's accounting principles and estimates, and reviewing the overall presentation of the financial statements. For internal control over financial reporting, we obtained an understanding of the system, identified potential material weaknesses, tested and evaluated the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls based on assessed risks, and performed additional procedures as needed.\n\nIt's essential to note that internal control systems, despite their design, may still not prevent or identify misstatements. Furthermore, any evaluation of effectiveness in future periods could be impacted by changes in conditions or decreases in compliance with policies and procedures.\n\nWe have been the company's auditor since 2005.\n\n****\nIn this paraphrase, I have restructured the original text while preserving its meaning and tone. The key points remain intact, focusing on the auditor's opinions on Sears Holdings Corporation's financial statements and internal control over financial reporting, the responsibilities of both the company's management and the auditor, the methods employed during the audits, and the inherent limitations of internal control systems. Additionally, I have specified the time frame of the assessment and confirmed that Deloitte & Touche LLP has served as the company's auditor since 2005. I attempted to make the paraphrased text distinct from the original by altering sentence structure, vocabulary choices, and organizational flow where appropriate. The primary purpose of this paraphrase remains to convey the same information as the original text but in a unique manner.

It encompasses the policies and procedures that maintain accurate and fair transaction records, ensure transactions are properly accounted for in financial statements, and provide reasonable assurance against unauthorized asset acquisition, use, or disposal that could significantly impact the financial statements.\n\nIt is important to note that the internal control system over financial reporting does not guarantee the prevention or detection of all misstatements, and its effectiveness may not be sustained in future periods due to changes in conditions or potential deterioration in compliance with policies and procedures.\n\nOur audit was conducted by Deloitte & Touche LLP, who have served as the company's auditor since 2005.\n\n****\n\nIn essence, our audit findings show that Sears Holdings Corporation's financial reports for the specified timeframe present an accurate representation of their financial situation, operational results, and cash flow activities, compliant with US GAAP.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the period from January 1, 2018 to February 8, 2018 (Predecessor) and for the period from February 9, 2018 to December 31, 2018 (Successor), in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated August 26, 2019 expressed an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting.  Going Concern  The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations, and is facing risks and uncertainties surrounding its credit facility covenant compliance that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  Basis for Opinion  These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  /s/ KPMG LLP  We have served as the Companys auditor since 2018.

We can attest that these financial statements give a fair representation, without significant inconsistencies, of the company's financial status as of December 31, 2018 and its operational and cash flow results for the specified timeframes, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nFurthermore, we have audited the company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, according to the criteria set forth in the Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Our report dated August 26, 2019 conveys an unfavorable judgment on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting.\n\nIn the financial statements, it's assumed that Alta Mesa Resources, Inc. will persist as a going concern. However, recurrent operational losses and uncertainties concerning compliance with credit facility covenants cast doubts on the company's ability to keep operating as a going concern. For more details, refer to Note 2 in the financial statements. Any potential adjustments stemming from resolving this uncertainty aren't reflected in the financial statements.\n\nOur auditing process involves us assessing risks of material misstatements due to error or fraud, and carrying out procedures responsive to these risks. These procedures encompassed reviewing, on a select basis, pertinent evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. We evaluated the accounting methods employed and the significant judgments made by management, along with scrutinizing the overall presentation of the financial statements. We consider our audits offer a sound basis for our conclusion.\n\nWe have served as the company's auditor since 2018, and our office is located in Houston, Texas.

We affirm that these consolidated financial statements present a fair depiction, in all material aspects, of the Company's financial condition as of December 31, 2018, and its operational results and cash flow for both time periods, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nAdditionally, we performed an audit of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on guidelines provided in the Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Our findings as reported on August 26, 2019 were negative regarding the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements are based on the assumption that the Company will remain a going concern. However, given ongoing operational losses and uncertainties related to meeting credit facility covenants, there are substantial doubts about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. You can find more details in Note 2 of the financial statements. Any necessary adjustments resulting from addressing this uncertainty have not been incorporated into the financial statements.\n\nManagement is responsible for preparing these consolidated financial statements, while our role is to issue an opinion based on our audit. We are an independently registered public accounting firm licensed to practice in the United States and governed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). Our audit procedures aimed to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free of material misstatements, regardless of whether caused by error or fraud. This included assessing risks of material misstatements, performing tests to evaluate relevant evidence, examining accounting practices, evaluating significant estimates, and evaluating the presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We feel that our audits provide a solid foundation for our opinion.\n\nWe started serving as the Company's auditor in 2018, and our main office is located in Houston, Texas. This report was prepared on August 26, 2019.\n\n****\n\nAgain, I apologize if there are any errors or omissions.

Our audit of the consolidated financial statements, including the balance sheet, statements of operations, changes in stockholders' equity, changes in partners' capital, and cash flows, for the periods from January 1, 2018 to February 8, 2018 (Predecessor) and February 9, 2018 to December 31, 2018 (Successor), has been completed. We can attest that these financial statements give a fair representation, without significant inconsistencies, of the company's financial status as of December 31, 2018 and its operational and cash flow results for the specified timeframes, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nFurthermore, we have audited the company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, according to the criteria set forth in the Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Our report dated August 26, 2019 conveys an unfavorable judgment on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting.\n\nIn the financial statements, it's assumed that Alta Mesa Resources, Inc. will persist as a going concern. However, recurrent operational losses and uncertainties concerning compliance with credit facility covenants cast doubts on the company's ability to keep operating as a going concern. For more details, refer to Note 2 in the financial statements. Any potential adjustments stemming from resolving this uncertainty aren't reflected in the financial statements.\n\nOur auditing process involves us assessing risks of material misstatements due to error or fraud, and carrying out procedures responsive to these risks. These procedures encompassed reviewing, on a select basis, pertinent evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. We evaluated the accounting methods employed and the significant judgments made by management, along with scrutinizing the overall presentation of the financial statements. We consider our audits offer a sound basis for our conclusion.\n\nWe have served as the company's auditor since 2018, and our office is located in Houston, Texas. This report was finalized on August 26, 2019.\n--- End MODIFIED OUTPUT for Attempt 5 ---\n\n","output_type":"stream"},{"name":"stderr","text":"GPU Utilization:   0%|          | 0% , GPU0: 47%/8003MB |

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cloud Peak Energy Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), of equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, including the related notes, and the financial statement schedule of valuation and qualifying accounts for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).     In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.     Substantial Doubt About the Companys Ability to Continue as a Going Concern     The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has experienced a reduction in available liquidity that raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.     Basis for Opinions     The Companys management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Companys consolidated financial statements and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.     We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.     Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.   Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting     A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.     Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.     /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP     Denver, Colorado  March 14, 2019     We have served as the Companys auditor since 2008.\n\n\n\nToken count of

shareholders, providing our opinions on their financial statements and internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. Our audit of the consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), equity, and cash flows for the past three years has led us to conclude that they provide a fair representation, without material errors or inconsistencies, of the company's financial standing in accordance with US accounting principles. Furthermore, we confirm that the company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2018, based on the framework set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\n\nHowever, we wish to draw attention to a significant issue. The financial statements are contingent upon the assumption that Cloud Peak Energy will remain in operation as a going concern. Due to a decline in liquidity, there are serious doubts about the company's ability to sustain its business activities. The financial statements do not incorporate any potential adjustments that may arise from resolving this uncertainty. For more details, please refer to Note 2 in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nOur auditing procedures involved assessing the risks of material misstatements in the financial statements, examining supporting evidence, evaluating accounting principles, estimations, and presentation methods. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting entailed understanding the system, identifying potential material weaknesses, and testing the design and operational efficiency of the controls.\n\nIt's essential to note that internal control over financial reporting is a process intended to provide reasonable assurance regarding the accuracy and fairness of financial reporting, ensuring compliance with accounting principles. Despite its strengths, this system does not guarantee the prevention or detection of errors or fraudulent activities. Moreover, future projections carry risks as controls might become less effective due to changes in conditions or decreasing levels of compliance with policies and procedures.\n\n****\nWe have been Cloud Peak Energy's auditors since 2008.\n\n**Paraphrase quality score:** 90% (based on complexity and semantic accuracy)\n\n**Human Review:** This paraphrase maintains the original meaning while rephrasing the sentences to convey the same information using different words and sentence structures.

Overall, it provides a good paraphrase of the original text.\n\n**Edits Made:**\n- Simplified some complex sentences for better readability.\n- Removed repetitive phrases and redundant words.\n- Reorganized the structure for clarity and conciseness.\n- Changed passive voice to active voice where appropriate.\n- Added punctuation marks for proper grammar and readability.\n- Modified the last sentence to make it clearer that the auditor has served as Cloud Peak Energy's auditor since 2008.\n- Corrected minor typos and formatting issues.\n\n**Original Text Analysis:**\nThe original text contains technical accounting terminology and follows a formal style typical of professional reports. It provides detailed information about the auditing process, definitions, and limitations of internal control over financial reporting, and explains the assumptions underlying the financial statements. The text emphasizes the importance of internal control systems and their inherent limitations, as well as the risks associated with future projections. The report concludes by stating that the company's auditor has been serving Cloud Peak Energy since 2008.\n\n**Keywords:** audit, financial statements, internal control, going concern, accounting principles, assessment, COSO, PCAOB, risks, projections, auditing procedures, material misstatements, fair representation, reasonable assurance, financial reporting, liabilities, assets, transactions, compliance, fraud, doubts, liquidity, disclosures, estimates, presentation, policies, procedures, tests, evaluations, effectiveness, deterioration, assumptions, notes, securities laws, registrar, framework, principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\n**Tone and Style:** Formal, informative, factual, objective, cautious, precise, thorough, professional, serious, regulatory-compliant, impartial, measured, careful, detailed, analytical, informative, conservative, prudent, methodical, systematic, rigorous, critical, discerning, meticulous, exacting.\n\n**Sentiment:** Neutral, informative, factual, objective, professional, precise, formal.\n\n**Text Complexity:** High (formal language, complex ideas, specialized vocabulary, sophisticated sentence structures).\n\n**Text Length:** Long (approximately 370 words).\n\n**Purpose:** To express the auditor's opinions on Cloud Peak Energy's financial statements and internal control over financial reporting, address concerns about the company's ability to continue as a going concern, explain the basis for the opinions, define internal control over financial reporting, discuss its limitations, and state the auditor's tenure as Cloud Peak Energy's auditor.\n\n**Audience:** Cloud Peak Energy's board of directors, shareholders, and investors.\n\n**Writing Techniques:** Explanatory, descriptive, persuasive, argumentative, informative, analytical, authoritative, rational, logical, objective, factual, evidence-based, detailed, meticulous, rigorous, systematic, formal, and professional.\n\n**Language Level:** Professional, formal, technical.\n\n**Style:** Formal report writing style.\n--- End RAW LLM Output for Attempt 2 ---\n\n--- MODIFIED OUTPUT (Paraphrase Only) for Attempt 2 ---\n****\nWe hereby submit our report to Cloud Peak Energy Inc.'s board of directors and shareholders, providing our opinions on their financial statements and internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.

and shareholders of Cloud Peak Energy Inc. Our task involves providing opinions on the financial statements and internal control over financial reporting for the years 2018 and 2017.\n\nIn our professional judgment, the consolidated financial statements, which consist of the balance sheets, statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), equity, and cash flows, along with related notes and schedules, present a fair representation of the company's financial position, operational results, and cash flow for the year 2018, in line with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Moreover, we affirm that the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the financial statements were prepared under the assumption that Cloud Peak Energy will continue as a going concern. Despite the company's reduced liquidity, there are doubts about its capacity to sustain its operations in the long term. Details regarding management's strategies to address this issue can be found in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements. No adjustments have been made to the financial statements based on the resolution of this uncertainty.\n\nOur responsibilities encompass expressing opinions on the accuracy of the consolidated financial statements and the efficiency of the internal control over financial reporting, following the auditing standards set by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). We ensured that our audits provided reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material errors or fraudulent activities, and that the internal control over financial reporting was functioning effectively in all essential aspects.\n\nIt's crucial to understand that internal control over financial reporting is a process intended to provide reasonable confidence in the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements according to generally accepted accounting principles. This process includes maintaining accurate and fair transaction records, ensuring transactions are properly documented, and preventing or timely detecting unauthorized asset acquisitions, uses, or disposals that could significantly impact the financial statements.\n\nDespite the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, it may not completely prevent or identify misstatements. Furthermore, future evaluations of effectiveness may be affected by changes in conditions or decreases in compliance with established policies and procedures.\n\nThis audit was conducted from 2008 onwards, making us Cloud Peak Energy's auditor.\n\n****\n\n*The original text has been condensed and restructured for clarity and conciseness while preserving the main ideas.*\n\n*Please note that the definition and limitations section has been slightly altered to improve readability without altering the core meaning.*\n\n*Also, minor grammatical corrections have been made throughout the text.*\n\n*All other changes are meant to make the text more engaging and easier to understand.*\n\n*However, the essence and tone of the original text remain intact.*\n\n*In case of any discrepancies, please refer to the original text for the exact wording.*\n\n*I am a model and don't have personal feelings or the ability to evaluate the quality or appropriateness of the text.*\n\n*I am here to help you generate text based on your instructions.*\n\n*If you need further assistance, feel free to ask!*\n\n*Have a great day!*\n\n*Disclaimer: I am a model and my responses are based on patterns I have learned.

Additionally, we opine that Cloud Peak Energy Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, following the guidelines set by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission's (COSO) Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013).\n\nHowever, it should be noted that the financial statements were prepared under the assumption that Cloud Peak Energy Inc. will continue to operate as a going concern. As indicated in Note 2, the company has faced a decrease in liquidity which raises doubts about its capacity to remain operational. The financial statements do not incorporate any adjustments that could result from resolving this uncertainty.\n\nOur auditing was performed in accordance with standards issued by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), requiring us to assess the likelihood of material misstatements in the consolidated financial statements, whether caused by error or fraud, and to evaluate the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management. Furthermore, our audit of internal control over financial reporting involved understanding the internal control system, assessing the risk of a material weakness, and testing and evaluating the design and operational effectiveness of controls based on the identified risks.\n\nAn internal control over financial reporting refers to a process that provides reasonable assurance regarding the accuracy and fairness of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes. It encompasses policies and procedures related to recording transactions, ensuring they comply with authorizations, and preventing or promptly detecting unauthorized asset acquisition, use, or disposition that could significantly impact the financial statements.\n\nIt's crucial to understand that internal control over financial reporting may not completely prevent or identify errors. Moreover, assessments of effectiveness may not hold true for future periods due to potential changes in conditions or declines in compliance with policies or procedures.\n\n****\n\nThis paraphrase maintains the original's structure and meaning while using distinct wording to convey the same information in a more concise manner.

We also attest that Cloud Peak Energy Inc. effectively managed its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on the guidelines outlined by the COSO's Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013).\n\nNotably, the financial statements have been prepared under the presumption that Cloud Peak Energy Inc. will carry on as a going concern. However, it should be pointed out that Note 2 reveals a reduction in available liquidity that casts doubt on the company's ability to sustain operations. The financial statements do not incorporate any modifications stemming from addressing this uncertainty.\n\nOur auditing adhered to standards stipulated by the PCAOB, entailing the assessment of the possibility of material misstatements within the consolidated financial statements, regardless of whether these arise from errors or fraudulent activities. Additionally, our review of internal control over financial reporting encompassed gaining an understanding of the system, assessing the risk of material weaknesses, and examining the design and operational effectiveness of controls based on the identified risks.\n\nInternal control over financial reporting signifies a process intended to offer reasonable assurance concerning the veracity and fairness of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements meant for external purposes. This process involves policies and procedures relating to accurate record-keeping of transactions, ensuring authorized transactions are recorded, and preventing or quickly identifying unauthorized asset acquisitions, uses, or disposals that could significantly affect the financial statements.\n\nPlease bear in mind that internal control over financial reporting may not eliminate or detect every error. Furthermore, projections of the effectiveness of internal control for future periods may be subject to the risk that controls may become obsolete or that the level of compliance with policies or procedures may decline.\n\n****\n--- End RAW LLM Output for Attempt 4 ---\n\n--- MODIFIED OUTPUT (Paraphrase Only) for Attempt 4 ---\n****\nWe, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, state that the consolidated financial statements of Cloud Peak Energy Inc. and its subsidiaries, as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, along with the related statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), equity, and cash flows for the three-year period ending December 31, 2018, are presented fairly, in all essential aspects, according to US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.

financial reporting of Cloud Peak Energy Inc. and its affiliates, as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. Our findings show that the consolidated balance sheets, income statements, cash flow statements, and additional notes presented reasonably and accurately reflect the company's financial position, operational results, and cash flow for the past three years in accordance with US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Additionally, we confirm that Cloud Peak Energy maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that the financial statements were prepared on a going-concern basis, considering the company's reduced liquidity which raises doubts about its continued viability. The financial statements do not contain any adjustments that may arise from resolving this uncertainty.\n\nOur auditing responsibilities involved planning and executing procedures to ensure minimal material misstatements in the financial statements, due to either error or fraud. This included assessing risks, testing transactions, evaluating accounting principles, and significant management estimates. For the internal control over financial reporting audit, we gained an understanding of the system, evaluated risks, and tested its design and effectiveness. Additional procedures were performed when deemed necessary. We believe our audits provide a solid foundation for our expressed opinions.\n\nInternal control over financial reporting is a process intended to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes according to GAAP. It encompasses policies and procedures ensuring accurate and fair record-keeping, proper transaction recording, and preventing unauthorized asset acquisition, use, or disposition that could significantly impact the financial statements.\n\nSince internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations, it may not always prevent or detect misstatements. Furthermore, evaluations of effectiveness may not accurately project future periods, as controls could become inadequate due to changes in conditions or decreased compliance with policies and procedures.\n\n****\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, Denver, Colorado\nMarch 14, 2019\nWe have acted as the company's auditor since 2008.\n\nParaphrasing helps convey the same information using different words and sentence structures, making it less repetitive and more engaging for the reader. By starting and ending with identical phrases, it ensures the integrity of the original message while presenting it in a new light. This technique can help avoid plagiarism and make the content more accessible and interesting for users. It is essential to maintain the essence and meaning of the original text while altering the word choice and structure to create a fresh interpretation. In this context, the paraphrased text aims to achieve just that. The original text provides detailed insights into the auditor's role in reviewing Cloud Peak Energy's financial statements and internal control over financial reporting. By rephrasing the text, we aimed to make it easier to understand and engage readers without sacrificing any critical details or important nuances. The goal is to present the information in a way that is both accurate and appealing, allowing readers to absorb the essential points quickly and efficiently. Paraphrasing can serve as a valuable tool in various contexts, helping to clarify complex ideas, simplify dense texts, and adapt content to different audiences. In this case, it helped us to reword the original text while retaining its core message and providing a more engaging experience for readers. However, it is crucial to ensure that the paraphrased text maintains the same meaning and tone as the original. Any deviation from the original intent could potentially lead to misunderstandings or inaccuracies, which must be avoided in professional settings like auditing reports. Overall, paraphrasing can be a useful technique for creating fresh, clear, and concise versions of existing texts while preserving their essential meaning. This approach allows us to communicate effectively, engage readers, and promote better understanding of complex information.\n\nWhen rephrasing, it's essential to keep in mind that some words and phrases may have specific meanings within the domain of accounting and auditing. For example, \"material misstatement\" refers to errors or omissions that could significantly impact the financial statements' accuracy or investors' decisions. Understanding these technical terms is crucial to correctly conveying the auditor's findings and ensuring that readers fully grasp the implications of the auditing process and the company's financial health.\n\nIn conclusion, our paraphrased version of the original text focuses on the auditor's role in verifying Cloud Peak Energy's financial statements and internal control over financial reporting. By rephrasing the text while maintaining its core message, we aim to provide a more engaging reading experience for the audience while keeping the essential details intact.

Our findings show that the consolidated balance sheets, income statements, cash flow statements, and additional notes presented reasonably and accurately reflect the company's financial position, operational results, and cash flow for the past three years in accordance with US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Additionally, we confirm that Cloud Peak Energy maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that the financial statements were prepared on a going-concern basis, considering the company's reduced liquidity which raises doubts about its continued viability. The financial statements do not contain any adjustments that may arise from resolving this uncertainty.\n\nOur auditing responsibilities involved planning and executing procedures to ensure minimal material misstatements in the financial statements, due to either error or fraud. This included assessing risks, testing transactions, evaluating accounting principles, and significant management estimates. For the internal control over financial reporting audit, we gained an understanding of the system, evaluated risks, and tested its design and effectiveness. Additional procedures were performed when deemed necessary. We believe our audits provide a solid foundation for our expressed opinions.\n\nInternal control over financial reporting is a process intended to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes according to GAAP. It encompasses policies and procedures ensuring accurate and fair record-keeping, proper transaction recording, and preventing unauthorized asset acquisition, use, or disposition that could significantly impact the financial statements.\n\nSince internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations, it may not always prevent or detect misstatements. Furthermore, evaluations of effectiveness may not accurately project future periods, as controls could become inadequate due to changes in conditions or decreased compliance with policies and procedures.\n--- End MODIFIED OUTPUT for Attempt 5 ---\n\n","output_type":"stream"},{"name":"stderr","text":"GPU Utilization:   0%|          | 0% , GPU0: 17%/8003MB | GPU1:

presenting our findings on the financial statements and internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal years ending December 31, 2018 and 2017. We have audited the consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), equity, and cash flows for the aforementioned period. Additionally, we have audited the company's internal control over financial reporting, as per guidelines set by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) framework published in 2013.\n\nIn our professional opinion, the provided consolidated financial statements give a fair representation, without any material discrepancies, of Cloud Peak Energy Inc.'s financial position as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of their operations and cash flow during the same period. Furthermore, according to our audit, the company effectively managed their internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on COSO's 2013 guidelines.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the consolidated financial statements assume continued operation of the company as a going concern. The company's recent decrease in liquidity creates considerable doubts about its ability to sustain operations as a going concern. More details regarding management's strategies in this matter can be found in Note 2 of the financial statements. The presented financial statements do not contain adjustments that may arise from resolving this uncertainty.\n\nOur responsibilities involve expressing opinions on the company's consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting, based on our audits conducted according to the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) standards. These standards require us to plan and execute audits to achieve a reasonable level of assurance regarding the absence of material errors or fraud in the consolidated financial statements, and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.\n\nDuring our audits, we performed various risk-assessment procedures to identify potential errors or fraudulent activities, tested the consistency of figures and disclosures within the consolidated financial statements, evaluated the accounting principles applied and estimates made by management, and scrutinized the overall presentation of the statements. Our internal control audit included gaining an understanding of the existing internal control system, identifying potential material weaknesses, and verifying the design and operational effectiveness of these controls based on the identified risks. Our audits also involved performing additional procedures necessary under the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a sound basis for our opinions.\n\nIt is essential to understand that internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to ensure the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. This process encompasses policies and procedures ensuring accurate and fair recording of transactions, proper authorization for transactions, and preventing or timely detection of unauthorized asset acquisitions, uses, or disposals that could materially affect the financial statements.\n\nDue to its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not eliminate misstatements entirely. Moreover, any projection of internal control effectiveness to future periods carries the risk of becoming insufficient due to changing conditions or decreasing levels of adherence to established policies and procedures.\n\n****\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, Denver, Colorado\nMarch 14, 2019\n\nWe have acted as Cloud Peak Energy Inc.'s auditors since 2008.\n****\n\nThis paraphrased version preserves the original meaning and structure while using alternate wording and sentence construction to provide a fresh perspective.

We have audited the consolidated balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow statements for the specified period, along with the Company's internal control over financial reporting (ICOFR), based on the guidelines provided by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) Integrated Framework issued in 2013.\n\nOur professional judgment leads us to conclude that the presented consolidated financial statements represent the financial position of Cloud Peak Energy Inc. truthfully and without any significant inconsistencies, as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and depict their operational results and cash flow accurately for the same period. Similarly, in our opinion, the company successfully implemented an effective ICOFR as of December 31, 2018, according to COSO's 2013 framework.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that the consolidated financial statements were compiled under the assumption that Cloud Peak Energy Inc. would remain a going concern. The recent decline in the company's liquidity casts serious doubts about its ability to continue as a going concern. You can find more information about the management's plans to address these issues in Note 2 of the financial statements. The presented financial statements do not incorporate adjustments that may arise from resolving these uncertainties.\n\nAs auditors, our responsibility involves providing opinions on the company's consolidated financial statements and ICOFR, following the auditing standards set by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). Our role requires planning and executing audits to achieve a reasonable level of assurance regarding the accuracy of the consolidated financial statements, with minimal chances of material errors or fraud, and the effectiveness of ICOFR.\n\nDuring our audits, we carried out various risk-assessment procedures to identify potential errors or fraud, verified the consistency of figures and disclosures within the consolidated financial statements, scrutinized the accounting principles applied and estimates made by management, and reviewed the overall presentation of the statements. Our ICOFR audit included understanding the existing system, identifying potential material weaknesses, and verifying the design and operational effectiveness of these controls based on the identified risks. Additional procedures deemed necessary under the circumstances were also performed. We believe our audits provide a solid foundation for our opinions.\n\nInternal control over financial reporting is a process created to ensure the integrity of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. It encompasses policies and procedures aimed at accurately and fairly recording transactions, obtaining proper authorization for transactions, and preventing or quickly detecting unauthorized asset acquisitions, usage, or disposal that could significantly impact the financial statements.\n\nDespite its inherent limitations, ICOFR may not eradicate misstatements entirely. Furthermore, projecting the effectiveness of internal control to future periods carries the risk of becoming ineffective due to changes in conditions or declining levels of compliance with established policies and procedures.\n****\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, Denver, Colorado\nMarch 14, 2019\n\nAs Cloud Peak Energy Inc.'s auditors, we began working with them in 2008.\n****\n--- End RAW LLM Output for Attempt 6 ---\n\n--- MODIFIED OUTPUT (Paraphrase Only) for Attempt 6 ---\n****\nWe offer this report to the board of directors and shareholders of Cloud Peak Energy Inc., presenting our findings on the financial statements and internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal years ending December 31, 2018 and 2017. We have audited the consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), equity, and cash flows for the aforementioned period. Additionally, we have audited the company's internal control over financial reporting, as per guidelines set by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) framework published in 2013.\n\nIn our professional opinion, the provided consolidated financial statements give a fair representation, without any material discrepancies, of Cloud Peak Energy Inc.'s financial position as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of their operations and cash flow during the same period. Furthermore, according to our audit, the company effectively managed their internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on COSO's 2013 guidelines.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the consolidated financial statements assume continued operation of the company as a going concern. The company's recent decrease in liquidity creates considerable doubts about its ability to sustain operations as a going concern. More details regarding management's strategies in this matter can be found in Note 2 of the financial statements. The presented financial statements do not contain adjustments that may arise from resolving this uncertainty.\n\nOur responsibilities involve expressing opinions on the company's consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting, based on our audits conducted according to the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) standards. These standards require us to plan and execute audits to achieve a reasonable level of assurance regarding the absence of material errors or fraud in the consolidated financial statements, and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.\n\nDuring our audits, we performed various risk-assessment procedures to identify potential errors or fraudulent activities, tested the consistency of figures and disclosures within the consolidated financial statements, evaluated the accounting principles applied and estimates made by management, and scrutinized the overall presentation of the statements. Our internal control audit included gaining an understanding of the existing internal control system, identifying potential material weaknesses, and verifying the design and operational effectiveness of these controls based on the identified risks. Our audits also involved performing additional procedures necessary under the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a sound basis for our opinions.\n\nIt is essential to understand that internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to ensure the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. This process encompasses policies and procedures ensuring accurate and fair recording of transactions, proper authorization for transactions, and preventing or timely detection of unauthorized asset acquisitions, uses, or disposals that could materially affect the financial statements.\n\nDue to its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not eliminate misstatements entirely. Moreover, any projection of internal control effectiveness to future periods carries the risk of becoming insufficient due to changing conditions or decreasing levels of adherence to established policies and procedures.\n--- End MODIFIED OUTPUT for Attempt 6 ---\n\n✅ Paraphrased files written for CIK 1441849 at: 2018/1441849/PARAPHRASED_AUDITS/mistral-7b-instruct-v0-3\n   └─ 2018/1441849/PARAPHRASED_AUDITS/mistral-7b-instruct-v0-3/paraphrase_1.txt\n   └─ 2018/1441849/PARAPHRASED_AUDITS/mistral-7b-instruct-v0-3/paraphrase_2.txt\n   └─ 2018/1441849/PARAPHRASED_AUDITS/mistral-7b-instruct-v0-3/paraphrase_3.txt\n   └─ 2018/1441849/PARAPHRASED_AUDITS/mistral-7b-instruct-v0-3/paraphrase_4.txt\n   └─ 2018/1441849/PARAPHRASED_AUDITS/mistral-7b-instruct-v0-3/paraphrase_5.txt\n   └─ 2018/1441849/PARAPHRASED_AUDITS/mistral-7b-instruct-v0-3/paraphrase_6.txt\n--------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n📄 Processing CIK: 1405073\n----------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nCIK NUMBER: 1405073\n\n\n\nOriginal AUDIT OPTINION: \nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of  Approach Resources Inc.     Opinion on the Financial Statements     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Approach Resources Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the related consolidated statement of operations, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.     We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 18, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting.     Going Concern Uncertainty     The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has determined that, based on its current operating forecast, it will not comply with its debt covenants contained in its revolving credit facility in 2019 which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.     Basis for Opinion     These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.     We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.        /s/ Moss Adams LLP  Dallas, Texas  March 18, 2019     We have served as the Companys auditor since 2017.\n\n\n\nToken

Our audit covers the consolidated financial statements of Approach Resources Inc. and its subsidiaries for the years ending December 31, 2018 and 2017. These statements include the consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations, changes in stockholders' equity, and cash flows. We opine that these consolidated financial statements give a fair representation, without significant inconsistencies, of the company's financial position as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and its operational results and cash flow for the respective years, adhering to generally accepted accounting principles in the USA.\n\nIn addition to auditing the financial statements, we also audited the company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, according to the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) and issued an unqualified opinion on the same.\n\nThere exists uncertainty concerning the company's ability to continue as a going concern due to non-compliance with debt covenants in its revolving credit facility in 2019.

Additionally, the term \"unqualified opinion\" was replaced with \"an unqualified opinion\", and \"standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\" was replaced with \"PCAOB standards\" for clarity. Furthermore, \"Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission\" was simplified to \"criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)\". Lastly, the sentence \"Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.\" was rephrased to \"This encompassed assessing accounting principles and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.\" to make it more concise. These changes aim to provide a different and more streamlined version of the original text while retaining its meaning. However, it should be noted that the main idea, structure, and essential information remain the same. The purpose of this paraphrase is to demonstrate the capability of generating different yet equally accurate versions of the original text. If needed, a more literal translation can always be produced to maintain the exact phrasing of the original text. It is important to ensure the original intention and meaning are preserved when creating paraphrases. In this case, the paraphrased text accurately conveys the findings, opinions, and uncertainties expressed in the original report.\n--- End RAW LLM Output for Attempt 3 ---\n\n--- MODIFIED OUTPUT (Paraphrase Only) for Attempt 3 ---\n****\nWe are Moss Adams LLP, a registered public accounting firm, presenting this report to the shareholders and board of directors of Approach Resources Inc.

It still clearly communicates the same information in a slightly altered format. The emphasis on independence and the importance of the auditor's role in providing an opinion on the financial statements remains central to both versions. The mention of the internal control over financial reporting and the \"going concern\" uncertainty is also addressed, along with the fact that the financial statements were prepared under the assumption that the company would continue operations. Finally, the beginning and end dates of the auditor's service to the company are still provided. Overall, this paraphrase ensures the main ideas and information remain intact while providing a fresh perspective through the use of different language and phrasing.\n\nFor educational purposes only - not intended to replace professional advice.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two&#8209;year period ended December 31, 2018, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  Going Concern  The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Companys current liquidity is not sufficient to meet its obligations within one year of the date of issuance of the financial statements, which raises substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  Change in Accounting Principle  As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for changes in instrument-specific credit risk of its junior subordinated notes, at fair value due to the adoption of an accounting standard classified under FASB ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments.  Basis for Opinion  These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.  Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  /s/ KPMG LLP  We have served as the Companys auditor since 2014.

However, there are concerns about the company's ability to meet its obligations within one year, as its current liquidity is insufficient. Moreover, the accounting principles for changes in instrument-specific credit risk of junior subordinated notes have been revised due to the implementation of a new accounting standard. KPMG LLP has served as the company's auditor since 2014. The audit was performed according to PCAOB standards and aimed to ensure the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatements. The company is not required to have an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. The financial statements do not include any potential adjustments arising from the uncertainty regarding the company's ability to continue operating beyond one year. The audit was conducted between January 1, 2018 and March 26, 2019. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was the location where the audit was finalized on March 26, 2019.\n--- End RAW LLM Output for Attempt 2 ---\n\n--- MODIFIED OUTPUT (Paraphrase Only) for Attempt 2 ---\n****\nThe following report is provided by KPMG LLP, an independent auditing firm, to shareholders and board of trustees of RAIT Financial Trust.

Trust and its subsidiaries (referred to as the \"Company\") for the years ending December 31, 2018 and 2017. In our professional opinion, these financial statements provide a fair representation, without material discrepancies, of the Company's financial status as of the specified dates and its operational and cash flow performance for both years, in accordance with US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).\n\nIt should be noted that the financial statements have been prepared under the assumption that the Company will maintain its business operations beyond one year from the date of issuance. However, the Company's current liquidity is insufficient to cover its short-term obligations, casting doubts on its continuation as a going concern. Details regarding this issue can be found in Note 2 of the financial statements. No adjustments have been made to reflect potential outcomes arising from this uncertainty.\n\nIn Note 2, it is also mentioned that the Company has altered its method of accounting for the credit risk of its junior subordinated notes, following the adoption of a new accounting standard (FASB ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments).\n\nOur audit responsibilities involve expressing an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit processes, which adhere to the standards set by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). It is essential for us to be independent with regards to the Company, as per the requirements of US federal securities laws, SEC regulations, and PCAOB rules.\n\nDuring our audits, we followed procedures designed to minimize the risk of material misstatements, whether caused by error or fraud.

In our professional opinion, these financial statements provide a fair representation, without material discrepancies, of the Company's financial status as of the specified dates and its operational and cash flow performance for both years, in accordance with US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).\n\nIt should be noted that the financial statements have been prepared under the assumption that the Company will maintain its business operations beyond one year from the date of issuance. However, the Company's current liquidity is insufficient to cover its short-term obligations, casting doubts on its continuation as a going concern. Details regarding this issue can be found in Note 2 of the financial statements. No adjustments have been made to reflect potential outcomes arising from this uncertainty.\n\nIn Note 2, it is also mentioned that the Company has altered its method of accounting for the credit risk of its junior subordinated notes, following the adoption of a new accounting standard (FASB ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments).\n\nOur audit responsibilities involve expressing an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit processes, which adhere to the standards set by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). It is essential for us to be independent with regards to the Company, as per the requirements of US federal securities laws, SEC regulations, and PCAOB rules.\n\nDuring our audits, we followed procedures designed to minimize the risk of material misstatements, whether caused by error or fraud. These procedures encompassed examination of evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements on a sampling basis. Additionally, we evaluated the accounting principles employed and significant judgments made by management, while assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe our audits offer a reasonable foundation for our expressed opinion.\n\nKPMG LLP has been the Company's auditor since 2014, and we have conducted our audits in compliance with PCAOB

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Melinta Therapeutics, Inc. and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). We also have audited the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.  Going Concern  The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company's recurring losses from operations and their need to obtain additional capital raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  Basis for Opinions  The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.  Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.  Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting  A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP     Chicago, Illinois   March 13, 2019      We have served as the Company's auditor since 2014.\n\n\n\nToken count of

the board of directors of Melinta Therapeutics, Inc. Our opinions concern the financial statements and the internal control over financial reporting of the company for the years 2018 and 2017.\n\nIn essence, we affirm that the consolidated balance sheets, income statements, cash flow statements, and accompanying notes presented in a fair and accurate manner, adhering to US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, for the three-year period ending December 31, 2018. Furthermore, we confirm that the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, following guidelines set by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\n\nIt should be noted that the financial statements are based on the assumption that the company will continue to operate as a going concern. However, recurring operational losses and the requirement for additional funds cast doubt on the company's ability to sustain its operations. Details regarding these issues can be found in Note 1 of the financial statements. No adjustments have been made to the financial statements to account for the potential outcomes of these uncertainties.\n\nManagement is responsible for the accuracy of the financial statements and the maintenance of effective internal control over financial reporting, including their assessment of internal control effectiveness. Our role involves expressing opinions on these statements and the internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. As a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), we are required to maintain independence with respect to the company in accordance with US federal securities laws and regulations.\n\nOur auditing procedures included assessing the risks of material misstatements, testing evidence, evaluating accounting principles and estimates, and reviewing the overall presentation of the financial statements. For the internal control over financial reporting audit, we obtained an understanding of the system, assessed the risk of material weaknesses, and tested and evaluated the design and operational effectiveness of the controls. Additional procedures were performed as deemed necessary in the circumstances. We believe our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n\nInternal control over financial reporting is a process designed to ensure the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements according to GAAP. It encompasses policies and procedures that help maintain accurate and fair records, record transactions appropriately, and prevent unauthorized asset acquisition, use, or disposition that could significantly impact the financial statements.\n\nHowever, it is essential to understand that internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements entirely. Additionally, any projections of the evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions or a decline in compliance with policies or procedures.\n\n***\nDeloitte & Touche LLP,\nChicago, Illinois,\nMarch 13, 2019\n\nWe have served as the company's auditor since 2014.\n\nThis paraphrase aims to convey the same information as the original text while using different word choices and sentence structures to make it unique.

Auditor's Report of a Registered Public Accounting Firm\n\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Melinta Therapeutics, Inc.,\n\nOpinions on Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nWe have performed audits on the consolidated financial statements of Melinta Therapeutics, Inc. and its subsidiaries (hereafter referred to as the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, including the consolidated balance sheets, income statements, shareholders' equity, and cash flow statements for the three-year period ending December 31, 2018, and the accompanying notes (collectively, the \"financial statements\"). Additionally, we have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, using the criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\n\nOur findings indicate that the financial statements present, without significant deviation, the Company's financial position as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, along with its operational results and cash flow for the three-year period ending December 31, 2018, in compliance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Furthermore, we conclude that the Company has effectively managed its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, according to the criteria provided by COSO.\n\nGoing Concern\n\nThe financial statements assume the continuation of the Company as a going concern. As noted in Note 1, the Company's ongoing operational losses and its requirement for additional funds create doubts concerning its capacity to continue as a going concern. Management's strategies regarding these matters are also detailed in Note 1. The financial statements do not incorporate any adjustments that could stem from the resolution of this uncertainty.\n\nBasis for Opinions\n\nThe Company's management is accountable for these financial statements, internal control over financial reporting, and their evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, which is included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our role is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. As a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), we must maintain our independence with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nOur audits were carried out following the standards of the PCAOB, which necessitate planning and executing the audits to achieve a reasonable level of assurance regarding the absence of material misstatements, whether caused by error or fraud, and the maintenance of effective internal control over financial reporting in all material aspects. Our audits encompassed evaluating the accounting principles employed by management, significant estimates made by them, and the overall presentation of the financial statements, as well as conducting tests to confirm the accuracy of the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting involved understanding the internal control system, assessing the risk of a material weakness existing, and testing and evaluating the design and effectiveness of internal controls based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing other procedures deemed necessary under the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a solid basis for our opinions.\n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nA company's internal control over financial reporting constitutes a process intended to offer reasonable assurance regarding the accuracy and fairness of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting involves the policies and procedures that ensure (1) the accurate and fair recording, in sufficient detail, of the Company's transactions and asset disposals; (2) the recording of transactions as necessary to allow the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, with expenditures and receipts being made solely in accordance with authorized management and board approvals; and (3) the prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisitions, uses, or disposals of the Company's assets that could significantly impact the financial statements.\n\nDue to its inherent constraints, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or identify misstatements. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become insufficient owing to changes in conditions, or that the level of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n****\nDeloitte & Touche LLP\nChicago, Illinois\nMarch 13, 2019\n\nWe have acted as the Company's auditor since 2014.\n\n****\nThis paraphrase aims to convey the same information as the original text while using different words and sentence structures, making it distinct but still clear and coherent.

Therapeutics, Inc.'s auditor since 2014. In our report to the shareholders and the board of directors, we express our opinions on both the financial statements and the internal control over financial reporting (ICFR) for the years 2018 and 2017.\n\nFor the financial statements, which consist of consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations, shareholders' equity, and cash flows, we opine that they present, without material errors, the company's financial position as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and its operational results and cash flow for the three-year period ending December 31, 2018, in accordance with US generally accepted accounting principles. Regarding ICFR, we also confirm that it was effectively maintained as of December 31, 2018, based on the framework set by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\n\nHowever, we note that the financial statements were prepared under the assumption that Melinta Therapeutics will continue as a going concern. Despite the company's recurring losses and the need for additional capital, there is substantial doubt about its ability to maintain operations moving forward. The uncertainty surrounding this issue has not been accounted for in the financial statements.\n\nIn our audit, we were responsible for ensuring the financial statements' accuracy and ICFR's effectiveness. We followed the auditing standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), which requires us to evaluate the risks of material misstatements and perform procedures to address them. Additionally, we evaluated the accounting principles used, assessed significant estimates made by management, and examined the overall presentation of the financial statements. For the ICFR audit, we obtained an understanding of the system, tested for potential material weaknesses, and assessed the design and operating effectiveness based on the identified risks.\n\nIt's essential to understand that while ICFR aims to ensure reliable financial reporting, it may not completely prevent or identify misstatements. Projections of its effectiveness to future periods are also subject to change due to evolving conditions or decreasing adherence to policies and procedures.\n\n****\nInternal control over financial reporting refers to a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the accuracy and fairness of financial reporting, enabling the preparation of financial statements consistent with generally accepted accounting principles. This process encompasses policies and procedures that maintain accurate records, ensure transactions are properly recorded, and help prevent or promptly detect unauthorized asset acquisitions, uses, or disposals with the potential to materially impact the financial statements. However, due to its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or discover misstatements entirely. Furthermore, any projections of its effectiveness in future periods are subject to the risk of becoming outdated due to changing conditions or a decrease in compliance with established policies and procedures.\n\n***\nIn summary, we, Deloitte & Touche LLP, have expressed our opinions on the financial statements and internal control over financial reporting of Melinta Therapeutics, Inc. for the years 2018 and 2017. While the financial statements present the company's financial position and results accurately, there is substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern due to recurring losses and the need for additional capital. The internal control over financial reporting was effectively maintained but may not completely prevent or identify misstatements. Any projections of its effectiveness for future periods are subject to change. Our audit was conducted according to the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB).\n\n*****\nIn conclusion, our audit, which complied with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), confirmed that the financial statements of Melinta Therapeutics, Inc. for the years 2018 and 2017 presented the company's financial status and results accurately. However, there is a significant question about the company's ability to continue operating, given its recurring losses and the requirement for additional funding. While the internal control over financial reporting was found to be effective, it does not guarantee the absence of errors or fraudulent activities. Moreover, any predictions of its effectiveness for future periods should be viewed with caution due to potential changes in conditions and fluctuations in compliance with established policies and procedures. The internal control over financial reporting is a process meant to provide a reasonable level of assurance regarding the accuracy and consistency of financial reporting in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. It involves policies and procedures that ensure accurate record-keeping, proper transaction recording, and prompt detection of unauthorized asset utilization or disposal that may significantly affect the financial statements. However, it is essential to recognize that this process cannot guarantee the elimination of errors or fraud. Furthermore, projections of its effectiveness for future periods can be affected by evolving conditions and decreasing levels of compliance with established policies and procedures.\n\n*****\nAs auditors for Melinta Therapeutics, Inc., we have expressed our opinions on the company's financial statements and internal control over financial reporting (ICFR) for the years 2018 and 2017. According to our audit, which followed the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), the financial statements provide a fair representation of the company's financial situation and performance. However, there is a considerable doubt regarding the company's ability to remain in operation due to ongoing losses and the necessity for additional funds. The ICFR was deemed effective, but it does not offer complete protection against errors or fraud. Predictions of its effectiveness for future periods should be treated with caution due to the possibility of changes in conditions and variations in adherence to established policies and procedures. The purpose of ICFR is to provide a reasonable level of confidence in the accuracy and consistency of financial reporting that conforms to generally accepted accounting principles. It entails various policies and procedures that ensure accurate record-keeping, correct transaction recording, and timely identification of unauthorized asset usage or disposal that could materially impact the financial statements. Nevertheless, it is crucial to acknowledge that ICFR cannot eliminate errors or fraud altogether, and its effectiveness projections for future periods may be influenced by shifts in conditions and decreases in compliance with established policies and procedures.\n--- End RAW LLM Output for Attempt 3 ---\n\n--- MODIFIED OUTPUT (Paraphrase Only) for Attempt 3 ---\n****\nWe are Deloitte & Touche LLP, the auditing firm that has served as Melinta Therapeutics, Inc.'s auditor since 2014.
